# Evaluating plate discipline in Major League Baseball with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees

This repository contains code from the paper *Evaluating plate discipline in Major League Baseball with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees*.

## Data

We used pitch data from the MLB's Statcaste database.
We scraped this data using the baseballr package.
This script was adapted from Bill Petti's [tutorial](https://billpetti.github.io/2021-04-02-build-statcast-database-rstats-version-3.0/).

## Modeling

We include code to reproduce the models we discuss in our paper.
All models are fit using the [flexBART](https://github.com/skdeshpande91/flexBART) package.
